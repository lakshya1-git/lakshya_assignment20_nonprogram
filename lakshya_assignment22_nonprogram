1. What is the result of the code, and explain?


>>> X = 'iNeuron'
>>> def func():
print(X)


>>> func()


2. What is the result of the code, and explain?


>>> X = 'iNeuron'
>>> def func():
X = 'NI!'


>>> func()
>>> print(X)


3. What does this code print, and why?


>>> X = 'iNeuron'
>>> def func():
X = 'NI'
print(X)


>>> func()
>>> print(X)


4. What output does this code produce? Why?


>>> X = 'iNeuron'
>>> def func():
global X
X = 'NI'


>>> func()
>>> print(X)


5. What about this code—what’s the output, and why?


>>> X = 'iNeuron'
>>> def func():
X = 'NI'
def nested():
print(X)
nested()


>>> func()
>>> X


6. How about this code: what is its output in Python 3, and explain?


>>> def func():
X = 'NI'
def nested():
nonlocal X
X = 'Spam'
nested()
print(X)


>>> func()
