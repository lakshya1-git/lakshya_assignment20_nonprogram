Answer1:
1 2 8
Because a , b value will be overwrite when calling function and c value is already 8

Anwer2:
 1 2 3 
Value of  a , b is defined on function but value of c will be over write.

Answer3: 1 (2, 3)
Value of prags will give (2,3)

Answer4: 1 {'c': 3, 'b': 2}
pargs will give output as key

Answer5:
1 5 6 5
Value of b,c will be 5,6



Answer6:

rint(l) # Output: 1
print(m) # Output: ['x']
print(n) # Output: {'a': 'y'} 
We define a function called func that takes three parameters: a, b, and c.
Inside the function, we perform the following operations:
Assign the value 2 to the variable a.
Modify the first element of the list b and change it to 'x'.
Modify the value associated with the key 'a' in the dictionary c and change it to 'y'.
Outside the function, we create three variables: l with the value 1, m as a list containing [1], and n as a dictionary with {'a': 0}.
We call the func function with the variables l, m, and n as arguments
